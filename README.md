The OpenSea Bot by David Nikolic is your ticket to NFT gold! This software makes automated offers on OpenSea listings, so you don’t have to spend every waking moment trying to find and buy NFT collections you’re after.

<h2>The easiest way to send OpenSea offers</h2>
<h3>Already added features:</h3>

<p><strong>Stay carefree with 99.8% up-time</strong></p>
<p>Every one of your automated offers will go out in time. That’s a guarantee. Our 99.8% up-time is something other bots can’t boast — and we’re working hard to push that to 100%!</p>

<p><strong>Secure & safe — backed by CSC</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fixed price offers</strong></p>
<p>Send fixed price offers on your selected listings or collections with specific traits [e.g., 0.01 Wrapped Ethereum (WETH)]. Never pay more than you want.</p>

<p><strong>Relative price offers</strong></p>
<p>Adjust your offers based on the collection’s floor price [set at 80% of the floor price so you can sell a collection for a healthy profit margin… as soon as tomorrow].</p>

<p><strong>Custom offer expiration</strong></p>
<p>Automatically withdraw listing offers after a set amount of time has passed [great for time-sensitive collections or for automatically clearing offers without having to keep a reminder about them].</p>

<p><strong>Bid based on specific traits</strong></p>
<p>Select listings you want to bid on. Automate offers on collections with specific traits so you never miss out because you couldn’t log in to OpenSea.</p>

<p><strong>Bid based on rarity</strong></p>
<p>Sort the listings by rarity (ranking) and bid only to the most valuable NFTs.</p>

<p><strong>Cutting-Edge Technology</strong></p>
<p>You don't need to worry about whether the software will stop working, or the offers will fail. Rest assured, no matter how many offers you plan to send, the software will do its job.</p>

<p><strong>Unlimited usage</strong></p>
<p>Send 1000s of offers every day. No cap. No slowdown. No additional fees.</p>
